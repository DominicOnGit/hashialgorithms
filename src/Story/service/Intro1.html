Sometimes the solution for a part of the puzzle is easy to see. E.g. if there is an island that
needs 4 bridges, and that island has only two neighbouring islands, then we need to connect both
neighbours with double bridges.
<br />
Let's try to formulate this rule as an algorithm:
<ol>
  <li>
    Find a vertex
    <ul>
      <li>with targetDegree 4</li>
      <li>and two incident edges</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    then select one of the incident edges
    <ul>
      <li>that has multiplicity less than 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>then increment the multiplicty of that edge.</li>
</ol>
